	abstract = {In this work I study the interaction of sophisticated trading agents with simpler agents in a prediction market. The goal is to simulate markets with both human and computer agents, and investigate ways to maximize the performance of these markets. I start with the neural net-based agent that is currently used in CCI's collective prediction experiments on football plays. By tuning their training and risk affinity, I configure a "smart" agent to represent the sophisticated computer traders. I implement three types of simple agents to approximate human traders - two are rule based, and one uses aggregate human data from lab experiments. By exploring different combinations of smart versus simple agents, I showed that it is possible for mixes of agents to outperform either types alone. This result is consistent with the larger goal of the collective prediction project, which is to show that humans and computer agents combined in a prediction market can do better than either alone.},

A Prediction Economy is composed of prediction markets, market managers, information brokers and automated trading agents. Two important goals of a Prediction Economy are to improve liquidity and information dispersal. Market managers automatically open and close appropriate markets, quickly giving traders access to the latest claims. Information brokers deliver parsed data to the trading agents. The agents execute trades on markets that might not otherwise have much trading action. Some preliminary results from a running Prediction Economy are presented, with binary markets based on football plays during a college football game. The most accurate agent chose to enter 8 of 32 markets, and was able to predict 7 of the 8 football play attempts correctly. Source code for the newly implemented tools is available, as are references to the existing open source tools used.},

	abstract = {From the Publisher:Over the past 25 years, the corporate world has undergone a transition from an industrial economy to an information economy - an environment where information drives the creation of wealth and prosperity, and where businesses accustomed to winning by virtue of size are losing their lead to competitors more agile in their use of information. Visionary companies have realized for years that succeeding in this new age will require better management of information - but up to now, too many have focused primarily on the management of information technology, and its potential for boosting worker productivity. This first volume in the Ernst \& Young Information Management Series emphasizes that organizations must learn to view information itself as a potent tool - and manage it as a resource that is more strategically important than labor or capital. Drawing on a wide range of studies and the experience of companies ranging from American Airlines to Frito-Lay, Managing Information Strategically explains how an organization must explicitly consider information issues in its overall strategic thrust - as it designs a plan to achieve market distinction, marshals the resources to execute that plan, and finally, integrates strategy with execution in a dynamic environment. In Part I, the authors examine the role of information in strategy design. They show how active management of information is required to define customers and market segments and discover the full nature of the competition; both are key elements in a company's ability to carve out a niche in the marketplace. The book also demonstrates how information in itself is increasingly being offered by companies as a differentiating product, and how it helps to inspire and support new strategic alternatives. Part II offers guidance on the management of information to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of important organizational processes.
